# Scrambling-To-Survive
 A Word Scramble Game 


This was originally for Ludum Dare 51 but I misjudged how long it would take me to figure out how to write a scramble algorithm,   this project works currently from levels 1-5  for scrambling the first pool of words

The player can move the letters of each scramble box up and down and then lock a letter in place,  once all  5 letters are locked it checks if the word is correct or not

I have plans on adding simple combat in the game, the timer is not your enemy it just makes your task harder. it's trying to survive while also unscrambling the word that will prove to be the challenge


This is currently still being worked on along with two other projects so updates may be slow
